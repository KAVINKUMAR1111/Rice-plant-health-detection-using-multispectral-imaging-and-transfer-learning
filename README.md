# Rice Plant Health Detection Using Multispectral Imaging and Transfer Learning

## Introduction
This project aims to detect the health of rice plants using multispectral imaging and transfer learning techniques. By leveraging a pretrained UNet model and processing images through a FastAPI backend with a PyQt front-end application, we provide a comprehensive solution for assessing plant health.

## Dataset
