# Rice Plant Health Detection Using Multispectral Imaging and Transfer Learning

This project aims to detect the health of rice plants using multispectral imaging and transfer learning techniques. By leveraging a pretrained UNet model and processing images through a FastAPI backend with a PyQt front-end application, we provide a comprehensive solution for assessing plant health.

## Dataset
The dataset used in this project can be accessed at https://drive.google.com/file/d/1NrOjqKNzkoxhjgnTPbVzZLDL6_Qmdudq/view?usp=sharing.

## Pretrained Model
The pretrained UNet model for segmentation is available at https://drive.google.com/file/d/10s4ikNGHhV7co4QYEjQPv-dNpuXB5Skx/view?usp=sharing.

## Installation
To set up the project, follow these steps:
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/KAVINKUMAR1111/Rice-plant-health-detection-using-multispectral-imaging-and-transfer-learning.git
2. Install the required dependencies.
3. Start the backend server: python backend.py
4. Launch the frontend application: Run the PyQT applicatation python frontend.py

## Usage
Upload images captured by NIR drones of a rice field and process them through the frontend. The regions highlighted in red indicate disease affected areas or unhealthy plant regions.
